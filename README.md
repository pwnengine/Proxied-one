I build this project because I needed an api to get proxies for my app ```https://surfshield.me/```.
It's a full stack application that anyone could use by fetching from ```https://api.proxied.one/get-proxies```.
It's completely free to use, but you can purchase an api key to remove amount limits. You could also get an unlimted experience by self hosting as the project is completely open-source.
